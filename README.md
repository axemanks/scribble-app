# Updates
## added social media share icons and cleaned up fonts an layout a bit

# ToDo
add image preview to be sent along with link when sharing to social media

Would like to implement a dashboard to see prevous generations, would require auth
Or maybe a front end where you can see community generated items.

# Open Graph notes
The landscape rectangle (1200 √ó 630 pixels) looks fantastic on Facebook shares, justifiably because Facebook develops the Open Graph system.
The minimum requirement is 200 by 200 pixels.
should not be more than 8 MB

og:image is needing to be passed and it is set in the header, but the url needs to be dynamic depending on what
prediction is being displayed
The url is working now, just need to figure out how ot implement getting the new screenshot of image, or maybe just display the AI generated. I think it would look better to have the scetch and AI image in the preview.
